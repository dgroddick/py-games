Python and Pygame
==================

This is a small collection of simple games made with Python and Pygame.

To run them you'll need Pygame installed.

```
$ sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip
$ python3 -m pip install pygame-ce
$ git clone https://github.com/dgroddick/py-games.git
```

These are work in progress.
To run the games, cd into the game folder and run python against the main game script.

eg:

```
$ cd pong
$ python3 pong.py
```
